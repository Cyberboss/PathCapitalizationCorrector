# PathCapitalizationCorrector
Tool to find pathnames in text files and fix any capitalization errors for files it can find on Win32

Made solely because I couldn't get CodeCoverage.exe reports on Coveralls.io to link to the correct files on github to due to it making all paths lowercase

See: https://github.com/Cyberboss/CyberEngineMkIII/pull/27
